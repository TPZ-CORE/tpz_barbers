# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. Added Hair Overlays for the female characters, this was a must which i totally forgot to add on the barbershop.

2. Added eyebrows support for hair overlays, the hair overlay changes reset the eyebrows for no reason, so i had to add eyebrow overlay support.

3. Fixed blip store interactions which were not active due to a miss-typo.

4. Fixed an issue with store, it would set the player on `NETWORK_START_SOLO_TUTORIAL_SESSION` which would cause all players to be invisible for this player.
